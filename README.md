Pong
====

### Introduction

  This project is a remake of the classic game [*Pong*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong "More about Pong") using C++ and OpenGL in a Unix-type OS.  
  My main objective is mainly to learn more of the new OpenGL while coding a simple game.

### Libraries

Extra libraries used are:

  - [**SFML**](http://www.sfml-dev.org/ "SFML website"), for creating an OpenGL context (aka "game window").

  - [**GLEW**](http://glew.sourceforge.net/ "GLEW website"), for implementing OpenGL functionality.

### Usage

  First of all, make sure that OpenGL 4.0 or higher is installed.

  **1.** Open the project's directory with a Terminal.
  
  **2.** Install SFML and GLEW with *make install*:

    $ make install

  **3.** Compile and run the program with *make run*:

    $ make run
